        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we can do anything with machine learning, we need to load our data—and one of the most common formats for storing data is CSV, which stands for *Comma-Separated Values*. A CSV file is simply a plain text file where each row represents a record (like a person, a review, or a product), and each value is separated by a comma.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python gives us a few ways to load CSV files into a program. The most common methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using Python’s built-in `csv` module  \n",
        "2. Using NumPy’s functions like `loadtxt` or `genfromtxt` (useful for numbers)  \n",
        "3. Using the `pandas` library and its `read_csv()` function (the most flexible and beginner-friendly)\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method has its own strengths:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Python’s csv module* is built in—you don’t need to install anything—but it requires a bit more effort to convert data into the types you need (like numbers or dates).\n",
        "- *NumPy* is great for large numerical datasets, but it can struggle with files that contain text, headers, or missing values.\n",
        "- *pandas* is the most popular option because it makes working with tables of data very easy. It automatically handles many of the common problems you might run into and gives you a powerful tool called a *DataFrame*—a table that you can search, filter, and analyse with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you’re curious about how CSV files are structured or why they work the way they do, there’s an official guide called [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) that describes the standard format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few things to check when loading a CSV file:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Header row*: Does the first line of your file contain column names (like \"Name\", \"Age\", or \"Review\")? If so, most tools can detect and use it automatically. If not, you’ll need to tell the tool what the column names should be.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Comments*: Some CSV files include comment lines that start with a symbol like `#`. These lines are meant for humans, not the program, so you may need to tell your loading function to skip them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Delimiter*: Although CSV stands for \"comma-separated\", sometimes other characters are used instead—like tabs (`\\t`) or semicolons (`;`). Make sure you specify the correct one so the data loads properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Quotes*: Some values in a file might contain commas, spaces, or special characters. To avoid confusion, these fields are wrapped in quotation marks (usually `\"`). If your file uses a different type of quote (like `'`), you’ll need to set that too.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you understand how your CSV file is set up, you’ll be able to load it correctly and avoid common errors—getting you one step closer to analysing and learning from your data."

        "\n",
        "We will use the **Pima Indians dataset** to demonstrate how to load data into python. This dataset describes medical records for Pima Indians, indicating whether or not each patient develops diabetes within five years.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Pima Indian diabetes dataset is a renowned benchmark in the field of machine learning. It was originally made available through the *National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)* in the United States, and later hosted on the *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Over time, it has become a standard reference dataset for illustrating and evaluating classification algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Who was studied\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dataset focuses on adult female patients (aged 21 or older) of Pima Indian heritage residing near Phoenix, Arizona.  \n",
        "- This population is known to have a significantly higher incidence of type 2 diabetes.\n",
        "### What was measured\n",
        "\n",
        "Each row in the dataset represents one person and includes *eight numbers* that describe their medical background and personal health measurements. These features help researchers and doctors predict the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s what each number means:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *Number of times pregnant* – How many times the participant has been pregnant (applies only to female patients in the dataset).  \n",
        "2. *Plasma glucose concentration* – The amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood after a two-hour test where the person drinks a sugary solution.  \n",
        "3. *Diastolic blood pressure* – The lower of the two blood pressure numbers, measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg).  \n",
        "4. *Triceps skin fold thickness* – A measurement in millimetres of the fat under the skin at the back of the upper arm.  \n",
        "5. *2-hour serum insulin* – The level of insulin in the blood two hours after the glucose test, measured in micro-units per millilitre.  \n",
        "6. *Body Mass Index (BMI)* – A number that shows whether someone is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, based on their weight and height.  \n",
        "7. *Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)* – A calculated value that estimates a person’s genetic risk of diabetes based on family history.  \n",
        "8. *Age* – The person’s age in years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, there’s a *binary outcome* called the *class*, *target*, or *label*, which tells us whether that person *did* or *did not* develop type 2 diabetes within the next five years. This is what models will try to predict using the other measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why it was collected\n",
        "\n",
        "Researchers aimed to investigate risk factors for diabetes among a group with a particularly high risk of the disease. Various medical and demographic data (such as glucose tolerance tests, insulin measurements, and age) were gathered to determine which factors most strongly predicted the onset of diabetes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How the data was obtained\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Patient recruitment**  \n",
        "   Eligible participants were female Pima Indians, aged 21 or older.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measurements and testing**  \n",
        "   Each participant underwent standard medical tests, including measuring plasma glucose concentration, blood pressure, and insulin levels, alongside providing demographic details such as age and number of pregnancies.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Five-year follow-up**  \n",
        "   The pivotal outcome was whether each participant experienced the onset of type 2 diabetes within five years. This information was determined through follow-up medical records and diagnoses.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Compilation**  \n",
        "   The anonymised data were assembled into a structured dataset of 768 entries, each representing a single participant’s measurements and diabetes outcome (onset or no onset).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Pima Indian diabetes dataset remains a pivotal resource for demonstrating fundamental classification techniques and exploring how demographic and medical attributes can help predict the onset of type 2 diabetes."

These features are all measured on different scales, which makes it harder for some models to interpret them fairly without some kind of adjustment.\n",

        "\n",
