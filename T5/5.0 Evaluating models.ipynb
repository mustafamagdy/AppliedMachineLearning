    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a model goes beyond simply reporting accuracy scores; it helps us determine how robust our model is, whether it generalises well to unseen data, and highlights areas where improvements may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on key techniques for evaluating machine learning models, covering a range of measurements and methods to check how well a model performs. This helps us understand whether a model is reliable and accurate enough to be useful in practice. We will discuss the following key techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Accuracy*: Measures overall correctness, useful primarily when classes are balanced and all errors have equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Precision*: Focuses on the correctness of positive predictions, especially critical when false positives are costly (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnostics).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Recall (Sensitivity)*: Captures the model’s ability to identify all true positives, essential when false negatives are highly consequential (e.g., cancer detection, security threats).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *F1 Score*: Provides a balanced metric between precision and recall, ideal for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets, such as detecting rare diseases or fraudulent activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ROC* (Receiver Operating Characteristic): Visualises the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at different threshold settings, useful for comparing multiple models and choosing appropriate classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *AUC* (Area Under the ROC Curve): Provides a single numeric measure summarising the overall ability of the model to discriminate between classes; a higher AUC indicates better overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Confusion Matrices*: Provide detailed visualisation of where a classification model makes correct or incorrect predictions, identifying true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: Evaluates models by equally penalising all prediction errors, offering robustness against outliers and clear interpretation (useful in scenarios like house price prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*: Strongly penalise larger errors, valuable when significant prediction errors must be avoided (e.g., stock price forecasting, energy consumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *R² Score*: Indicates how much variability in data is captured by the model, providing an intuitive understanding of model performance in predicting continuous outcomes, such as consumer spending or crop yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation for Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Accuracy and Loss Curves*: Track training and validation performance over time, helping diagnose issues like overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Cross-Entropy Loss*: Measures the performance of classification neural networks, effectively quantifying how well predicted probabilities match the true class labels."

    "\n",
    "The *SpamBase dataset*, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is commonly used in machine learning experiments focused on detecting spam emails. The goal of this dataset is to classify emails as either spam (unwanted commercial or malicious emails) or ham (legitimate, non-spam emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 4601 emails.\n",
    "- Features (attributes): 57 numeric attributes\n",
    "- Features represent word frequency (e.g., \"free\", \"credit\", \"money\"), character frequencies (e.g., exclamation marks \"!\", dollar signs \"$\"), and other indicators often found in spam emails.\n",
    "- Target Variable (Class Label):\n",
    "- is_spam: Binary class label (1 indicates spam, 0 indicates legitimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we're testing a model designed to detect spam emails and it has been trained on some training data. Assume, we have a test dataset containing 200 emails in total.  Of these, 100 are actually *spam* and 100 are actually genuine (*not spam*). The machine learning model makes predictions about which emails are spam, and we record the predicted label.\n"

    "### Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy is a fundamental metric used to evaluate classification models, measuring the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total number of predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of correct predictions to the total dataset size, providing a straightforward way to assess overall model performance. For example, if a model correctly classifies 90 out of 100 test samples, its accuracy is 90%. This metric is particularly useful when dealing with balanced datasets, where all classes have roughly equal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, accuracy can be misleading when applied to imbalanced datasets. In cases where one class significantly outnumbers another, a model could achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class while failing to correctly classify the minority class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a fraud detection scenario where 98% of transactions are legitimate, a model that predicts \"not fraud\" for every instance would still achieve 98% accuracy, despite failing to detect any fraudulent transactions. Additionally, accuracy does not distinguish between types of errors—false positives and false negatives are weighted equally, which may not be suitable for applications where certain types of errors carry greater consequences, such as medical diagnoses or security systems. For such cases, precision, recall, and the F1-score provide a more meaningful assessment of model performance."

This includes a *dropout layer* -- a safety mechanism that randomly turns off some connections during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one pattern. This helps avoid overfitting, so that the network does not simply memorise the training data, but instead can generalise to new inputs). \n",

    "\n",
    "- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*:  \n",
    "  Calculates the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. Squaring errors gives more weight to larger errors, making it sensitive to significant deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*:  \n",
    "  The square root of MSE, bringing the metric back to the original units of measurement. It's widely used due to interpretability in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)*:  \n",

For example, RMSE and R-squared are commonly used together: RMSE gives an intuitive understanding of error magnitude, while R-squared provides insight into the explanatory power of the model.\n",

    "### MAE\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) offers a straightforward average of errors without exaggerating outliers. MAE is a simple but powerful way to measure how accurate predictions from a model or forecast are compared to actual observed values. Imagine you're trying to guess how many candies are in several jars, and each guess might be a bit off. MAE is the average of how far off all your guesses were, regardless of whether you guessed too high or too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, MAE takes the absolute difference between predicted values and the actual values—this means it doesn't matter whether your predictions were higher or lower; only the size of the errors matters. It then averages these differences to provide a single number that clearly represents the typical prediction error you can expect from your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "People often use MAE because it’s straightforward and intuitive—easy to understand even without a technical background. For example, if you're predicting house prices, an MAE of 10,000 would mean your predictions are typically off by about \\$10,000, giving you a clear, practical sense of the accuracy and reliability of your predictions."

    "### MSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) highlights significant prediction errors, penalising large deviations heavily. MSE is a common way of measuring how accurate predictions are, especially in scenarios where larger mistakes are particularly important. Imagine you're throwing darts at a dartboard, and each dart represents your prediction. MSE doesn't just measure how far off each dart is from the bullseye—it actually squares that distance. This means that predictions which miss by a lot are heavily penalized compared to smaller errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate MSE, you take each prediction error (the difference between your prediction and the real value), square it (which makes every error positive and exaggerates big mistakes), and then average all those squared errors. Squaring the errors helps highlight predictions that are significantly wrong, ensuring models that make big mistakes appear clearly worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this approach, MSE is especially useful in situations where large errors can have big consequences. For example, in predicting house prices, a prediction that's off by $100,000 would have an enormous impact compared to predictions off by just a few thousand dollars. When using MSE, you ensure that the final measure emphasises and discourages these large mistakes, helping you build a more reliable and accurate predictive model."

    "### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a popular way to measure how accurate predictions are—think of it as a \"typical size\" of the prediction mistakes a model makes. To understand RMSE, imagine you're predicting how long it takes to drive home from work. Sometimes you underestimate by a few minutes; other times, traffic makes you underestimate by a lot more. RMSE helps summarize these errors into one clear number.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of MSE, easier to interpret in terms of original units of measurement. To calculate RMSE, first, you find the difference between each prediction and the real observed value, and then square each of those differences. Next, you take the average (mean) of all these squared errors. Finally—and importantly—you take the square root of that average. The result gives you an error measure that's on the same scale as your original data, making it intuitive and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is valuable because it highlights larger errors (due to squaring earlier in the calculation) but returns to the original units (like minutes, dollars, or miles) thanks to taking the square root at the end. For example, an RMSE of 5 minutes in your commuting prediction model tells you that typically, your predictions are off by around 5 minutes, providing a simple way to judge the accuracy of your predictions at a glance."

    "### R² Score\n",
    "The *R² Score*, also known as the *coefficient of determination*, is a popular measure used to indicate how well predictions made by a statistical model match the actual observed data. Think of it as a percentage score, telling you how much of the variability in the data your model successfully explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, an R² value ranges from 0 to 1. A score of 1 means your model perfectly predicts every single observation—it's as if you had accurately guessed the exact height of everyone in a room. A score of 0, however, indicates your model performs no better than simply using the average of the data as your prediction, similar to guessing everyone’s height is the same, average height. It’s also possible to have negative R² values, meaning your model is actually doing worse than just guessing the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's expressed as a percentage-like measure, R² is very intuitive. For example, if a house-price prediction model has an R² score of 0.8, this means that 80% of the variability in house prices can be explained by the model, while the remaining 20% is due to factors the model doesn't account for. This makes R² a useful and easily understandable way to judge the effectiveness of predictive models."

    "For classification tasks, accuracy works best when your classes are balanced and errors carry equal importance. However, in scenarios where classes are imbalanced or the cost of mistakes differs significantly—such as detecting fraud or diagnosing diseases—it’s preferable to rely on precision, recall, or the F1 score to evaluate your model. Always examine the confusion matrix as well, since it provides clear insight into exactly how your model is making correct and incorrect predictions.\n",

    "For regression tasks, the R² score helps you understand how much of the variability in your data is explained by your model. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a robust measure that's less sensitive to outliers, making it suitable for general predictions like house prices or temperature forecasts.
